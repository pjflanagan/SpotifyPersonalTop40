# SpotifyPersonalTop40
I don't have enough room on my phone to save multiple playlists, I also don't have enough data to constantly listen to songs on the go. This program automatically saves exactly 40 songs to my phone by adding songs I save to My Library to the only saved playlist I have. That way, when I'm on the bus or walking around town, I'll always have my 40 most recently added songs saved to my phone.
